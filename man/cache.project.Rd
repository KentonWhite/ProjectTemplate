\usage{
cache.project()
}
\value{
No value is returned; this function is called for its side
effects.
}
\description{
This function will cache all of the data sets that were
loaded by the \code{\link{load.project}} function in a
binary format that is easier to load quickly. This is
particularly useful for data sets that you've modified
during a slow munging process that does not need to be
repeated.
