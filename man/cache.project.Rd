\title{Cache a project's data sets in binary format.}
\usage{

}
\arguments{
  \item{envir}{The environment, defaults to the global
  environment.  In most use cases this parameter can be
  omitted.}
}

No value is returned; this function is called for its side effects.
}
\description{
This function will cache all of the data sets that were loaded by
the \code{\link{load.project}} function in a binary format that is
easier to load quickly. This is particularly useful for data sets
that you've modified during a slow munging process that does not
need to be repeated.
