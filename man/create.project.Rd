  \item{project.name}{A character vector containing the
  name for this new project. Must be a valid directory name
  for your file system.}

  \item{minimal}{A boolean value indicating whether to
  create a minimal project or a full project. A minimal
  project contains only the directories strictly necessary
  to use ProjectTemplate and does not provide template code
  for profiling, unit testing or documenting your project.}

  \item{dump}{A boolean value indicating whether the entire
  functionality of ProjectTemplate should be written out to
  flat files in the current project.}

No value is returned; this function is called for its side

\description{
This function will create all of the scaffolding for a new
project. It will set up all of the relevant directories and
their initial contents. For those who only want the minimal
functionality, the \code{minimal} argument can be set to
\code{TRUE} to create a subset of ProjectTemplate's default
directories. For those who want to dump all of
ProjectTemplate's functionality into a directory for
extensive customization, the \code{dump} argument can be
set to \code{TRUE}.
