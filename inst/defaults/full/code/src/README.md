Here you'll store your final statistical analysis scripts. You should add the following piece of code to the start of each analysis script: `library('ProjectTemplate); load.project()`. You should also do your best to ensure that any code that's shared between the analyses in `src` is moved into the `munge` directory; if you do that, you can execute all of the analyses in the `src` directory in parallel. A future release of ProjectTemplate will provide tools to automatically execute every individual analysis from `src` in parallel.
