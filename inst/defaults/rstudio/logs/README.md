Here you can store a log file of any work you've done on this project.
If you'll be logging your work, we recommend using the [log4r][1] package,
which ProjectTemplate will automatically load for you if you turn the `logging`
configuration setting on.

The default loglevel is set at "INFO", but can be configured using the
`logging_level` setting in the configuration.
For valid levels see the `log4r` documentation.
