ProjectTemplate is a system for automating the thoughtless parts of a data analysis project:

* Organizing the files in your project.
* Loading all the R packages you'll use.
* Loading all of your data sets into memory.
* Munging and preprocessing your data into a form that's suitable for analysis.

In addition to automating the drudge work of analyzing data, ProjectTemplate hopes to promote better coding and analysis practices by:

* Curating the best R packages.
* Providing simple tools for keeping a log of your work
* Providing template code for:
	* Data diagnostics
	* Data munging
	* Code profiling
	* Unit testing

To learn how to use ProjectTemplate, we suggest going through the [ProjectTemplate tutorial](./getting_started.html).
