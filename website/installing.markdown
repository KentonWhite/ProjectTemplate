## Installing
ProjectTemplate is on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ProjectTemplate/) and can be installed using a simple call to `install.packages()`:

    > install.packages('ProjectTemplate')

### Installing development version
For inexperienced users, running the bleeding edge version of ProjectTemplate is probably a mistake.
It is generally less stable than the versions that have been released on CRAN and is usually a little out of sync with the documentation.
That said, if you'd like to use the most recent version of ProjectTemplate, you can also install the
[`devtools`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package from CRAN and then type

    > devtools::install_github('johnmyleswhite/ProjectTemplate')

to install ProjectTemplate from source.
