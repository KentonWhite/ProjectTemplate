Description: The ProjectTemplate package provides a function, create.project(), that automatically builds a directory for a new R project with a clean sub-directory structure and automatic data and library loading tools. The hope is that standardized data loading, automatic importing of best practice packages, integrated unit testing and useful nudges towards keeping a cleanly organized codebase will improve the quality of R coding.
