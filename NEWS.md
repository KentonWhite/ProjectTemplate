v0.5 (2014-03-05)
===

Features
---

* Many functions now have a parameter `envir` that defaults to `.GlobalEnv`.
  This stops `R CMD check --as-cran` from complaining about assigning to the
  global environment, and allows executing projects in an isolated environment
  (#39, #63).
* Attempting to load a missing package when reading data will lead to a
 user-friendly error message (#26).
* Export existing `translate.dcf` function, useful for implementing custom readers (#59).
* Add new function `.add.extension.` This allows users to create custom readers
  for extensions, either locally in a project or as packages (#59).

Internal
---

* Fix CRAN warnings concerning use of `ProjectTemplate:::` qualification
  (#56).
* Updated author information in DESCRIPTION file (#40).
* Store templates for empty projects in tar files instead of storing
  the entire directory structure per CRAN request and to avoid having to build
  with the `--keep-empty-dirs` switch (#41).

v0.4-5 (2014-02-11)
===

* New maintainers: Kirill MÃ¼ller  <mail@kirill-mueller.de>, Kenton White  <jkentonwhite@gmail.com>
* Allow string interpolation of R functions in sql queries
* Added a JDBC database wrapper for accessing PostgreSQL databases hosted by Heroku (#20)
* JDBC connection can now use path to jar stored in CLASSPATH
* project.info is stored in the global environment again (reverted change from
  0.4-4); the active binding seemed to work for the tests but not from outside
  the package
* create.project now works if the directory exists. Merging with a non-empty
  directory is supported by setting the new parameter merge.strategy.
