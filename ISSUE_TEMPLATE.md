## Actual Behavior

## Steps to Reproduce Behavior

## Issue Severity Classification - Select from:
### (1) Severe   - Fully impedes usage of `ProjectTemplate`. This condition requires an immediate solution.  `ProjectTemplate` is unable to operate or caused other critical software to fail and there is no acceptable way to work around the problem.
### (2) Moderate - Significant impact.  `ProjectTemplate` is usable but is limited. Work around exists, but requires significant effort. [Incomplete/incorrect documentation, poor or unexplained log messages where no clear error was evident, side effect is observed which does not significantly harm operations etc]
### (3) Low      - Minimal impact. Issue is an annoyance, but I can get work done. This indicates the problem causes little impact on operations or that a reasonable circumvention to the problem has been implemented. [Usability quirks, requires minor documentation updates, or could be enhance with some minor changes to the function.]
