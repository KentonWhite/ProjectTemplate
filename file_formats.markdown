# File Formats
ProjectTemplate can automatically load a variety of CSV-like file formats,
including compressed CSV files. In addition, automatic loading is supported
for the binary RData, Stata and SPSS file formats. Finally, ad hoc file
types support the loading of any file format files that are accessible over HTTP and
the automatic loading of data from MySQL tables.

N.B.: The SPSS and Stata file formats have not been tested yet. Because
ProjectTemplate is simply wrapping the 'foreign' library, they are expected
to work, but I have not confirmed this yet. Your mileage may vary.

# Ad Hoc File Types
## URL Files
You can access CSV files over HTTP using the `.url` file extension. Inside
of the `.url` file, you must place YAML that describes your data source.
Only one source per file is accepted.
An example file is shown below.

    url: "http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/ProjectTemplate/sample_data.csv"

## SQL Files
You can access database stored in a MySQL database using the `.sql` file
extension. Inside of the `.sql` file, you must place YAML that describes
the connection protocol for your database. An example file is shown below.

    type: mysql
    user: sample_user
    password: sample_password
    host: localhost
    dbname: sample_database
    table: sample_table
